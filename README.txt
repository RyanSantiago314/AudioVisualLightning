A lightning particle system that emits lightning when the playing audio
(in this case music) fulfills certain criteria. There are three different
particle systems that all use the same base particle but emit lightning
in different formations, sizes, and colors. The frequency, color, and 
brightness of the lightning is dependent on the parameters of the playing 
audio. One increases the number of particles emitted and their speed based 
on the track's volume. This system emits lightning that is usually 
predominantly purple or yellow based on the color mode that is active. 
Another emits five at once when a different threshold is met or exceeded. 
The lightning from this system is usually green or blue. The last system 
is the most rare to activate and emits one very large bolt of lightning at 
a time. It is red or purple based on the coloring mode.
